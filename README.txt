# Programmable-matter
A programmable matter is simply one that has the ability to process information. While this might sound like a myth, there are several schools of thought on the manner this can be achieved. Some opine that the programmable element could be external to the material and others opine that the material itself can compute and the result of this computation is a change in the materials physical properties.

The version presented here is a variant of the two and can be carried out in multiple stages. The first stage is to show that this is possible and the material of choice here is a metal, Aluminium, based on it's availability and useability. In a bid to generate original data, series of tests was carried out on a sample of the specimen. These data when analyzed revealed interesting patterns and by studying these patterns, useful predictions can be made ... 


The behaviour/performance of materials in service have been known for a long time to affect it's properties. And in the folder:raw data, is a representation of a material property(Ultimate Tensile Strength) and Extension when drawn to failure in a Tensile testing machine. The data was cleaned and parsed to produce the content of the folder: csv_files. This cleaning was done using the script in the scripts folder: analysis_one.py.

Some calculation was done in the calc.py and comp_uts.py scripts and in the bubble_one.py is a bubble chart illustraing the overall relationship. A sample of the bubble chart is in the pictures folder
